    "description": "A laptop is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with a thin LED computer screen mounted on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard on the inside of the lower lid. Laptops combine all the input/output components and capabilities of a desktop computer, including the display screen, small speakers, a keyboard, data storage device, optical disc drive, pointing devices (such as a touchpad or trackpad), a processor, and memory into a single unit. Most modern laptops feature integrated webcams and built-in microphones, while many also have touchscreens. Laptops can be powered either from an internal battery or by an external power supply from an AC adapter."
